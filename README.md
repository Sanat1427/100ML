🚀 100 Days of Machine Learning (100-ML)

This repository contains my complete Machine Learning journey from beginner to advanced level.
It is designed as a step-by-step learning path, covering concepts, implementations, and hands-on projects using Python.

The goal of this repo is to:

Build strong ML fundamentals

Practice concepts with clean code

Create a single reference for revision and interviews

📌 What This Repository Covers

Python for Machine Learning

Mathematics for ML (basics)

Data Analysis & Visualization

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Classical Machine Learning Algorithms

Model Evaluation & Metrics

Feature Engineering

Machine Learning Pipelines

Mini Projects & Case Studies

Advanced ML concepts (gradually added)
